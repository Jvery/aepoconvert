# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Next.js 16.1.1 is installed when using `create-next-app@latest` (newer than the "14" mentioned in PRD, but compatible)
- Strict mode is already enabled by default in new Next.js projects
- Need to create project in temp location then copy files to avoid overwriting existing files (PRD.md, progress.txt)
- shadcn/ui: In newer versions, `--style` flag is removed; New York is the default style
- shadcn/ui: Use `--defaults --base-color zinc --yes` flags for non-interactive setup
- shadcn/ui: Tailwind v4 is automatically detected and configured
- shadcn/ui: `toast` component is deprecated, use `sonner` instead
- next-intl: Need to create src/i18n/routing.ts with defineRouting for middleware configuration
- next-intl: createNextIntlPlugin in next.config.ts takes path to request.ts file as argument
- Next.js 16: "middleware" file convention is deprecated, prefer "proxy" (but still works for now)

## Iterations

### Iteration 1 - US-001: Initialize Next.js 14 project
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**What was done:**
- Created Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router, src-dir structure
- Verified tsconfig.json has strict mode enabled
- Verified `npm run dev` starts without errors
- Verified `npm run build` (typecheck) passes

---

### Iteration 2 - US-002: Install and configure shadcn/ui
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**What was done:**
- Ran `npx shadcn@latest init --defaults --base-color zinc --yes` (New York style is now the default)
- Verified components.json created with correct paths (style: "new-york", baseColor: "zinc")
- Installed Button component with `npx shadcn@latest add button`
- Updated page.tsx to render Button components (default and outline variants)
- Verified typecheck passes with `npm run build`
- Verified Button renders correctly in browser

**Learnings:**
- In newer shadcn versions, `--style` flag is removed; New York is the default style
- Use `--defaults --base-color zinc --yes` flags for non-interactive setup
- Tailwind v4 is now detected and used by shadcn

---

### Iteration 3 - US-003: Add essential shadcn components
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**What was done:**
- Installed shadcn components: card, select, slider, progress, sonner, tabs, dialog, tooltip, badge, dropdown-menu
- Note: `toast` component is deprecated, used `sonner` as replacement
- Verified all components are importable from `@/components/ui/*`
- Verified typecheck passes with `npm run build`

**Learnings:**
- The `toast` shadcn component is deprecated and replaced by `sonner`
- Use `npx shadcn@latest add sonner` instead of `npx shadcn@latest add toast`

---

### Iteration 4 - US-004: Setup i18n architecture with next-intl
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**What was done:**
- Installed `next-intl` package
- Created `messages/en.json` with common, upload, convert, settings sections
- Created `src/i18n/request.ts` with getRequestConfig for locale loading
- Created `src/i18n/routing.ts` with defineRouting configuration (locales: ['en'], defaultLocale: 'en')
- Created `src/middleware.ts` for locale routing using createMiddleware
- Updated `next.config.ts` with createNextIntlPlugin wrapper
- Wrapped app layout with NextIntlClientProvider using getLocale() and getMessages()
- Verified typecheck passes with `npm run build`

**Learnings:**
- next-intl requires both routing.ts and request.ts configuration files
- createNextIntlPlugin takes path to request.ts as argument
- NextIntlClientProvider requires async layout function with getLocale() and getMessages() from 'next-intl/server'
- Next.js 16.1.1 shows deprecation warning for "middleware" file convention, recommending "proxy" instead
