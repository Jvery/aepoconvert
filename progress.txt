# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Next.js 16.1.1 is installed when using `create-next-app@latest` (newer than the "14" mentioned in PRD, but compatible)
- Strict mode is already enabled by default in new Next.js projects
- Need to create project in temp location then copy files to avoid overwriting existing files (PRD.md, progress.txt)

## Iterations

### Iteration 1 - US-001: Initialize Next.js 14 project
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
**What was done:**
- Created Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router, src-dir structure
