# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)
- Next.js 16.1.1 is installed when using `create-next-app@latest` (newer than the "14" mentioned in PRD, but compatible)
- Strict mode is already enabled by default in new Next.js projects
- Need to create project in temp location then copy files to avoid overwriting existing files (PRD.md, progress.txt)
- shadcn/ui: In newer versions, `--style` flag is removed; New York is the default style
- shadcn/ui: Use `--defaults --base-color zinc --yes` flags for non-interactive setup
- shadcn/ui: Tailwind v4 is automatically detected and configured
- shadcn/ui: `toast` component is deprecated, use `sonner` instead
